Introduction
Accurately predicting house prices is essential for real estate stakeholders to make informed decisions. This project uses a machine learning pipeline to preprocess data, select features, and train a model capable of making reliable house price predictions.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes:

Features: Location, area, number of rooms, year built, etc.
Target Variable: Price of the house.
Source: [Include source if applicable, e.g., Kaggle, public dataset, or a proprietary source.]

Feature Engineering
To improve model accuracy, the following steps were performed in the feature engineering phase:

Handling Missing Values: Imputed missing values for continuous and categorical features.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Applied one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
Feature Scaling: Standardized numerical features to improve model performance.
New Features: Created derived features (e.g., price per square foot) to enhance prediction power.
Model Selection
Several machine learning models were evaluated, including:

Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
After experimenting with these models, [mention the best-performing model] was selected based on performance metrics and cross-validation results.

Evaluation
The model’s performance was evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared (R²) Score
